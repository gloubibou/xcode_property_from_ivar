h1. Xcode property from ivar

This is 99.9% the very handy script from "Cocoa with Love":http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/12/instance-variable-to-synthesized.html . All that I've added is support for underscore naming of ivars (which will generate a synthesize with an alias) and an explicit "assign" declaration for non-pointer types (just because I like it).

h1. Installation Instructions
# Open Xcode, go to Scripts menu, select Edit User Scripts
# Add a new shell script (I put it under the "Code" section)
# Double-click the name to change it ("Generate Property" is what I use)
# Double-click the cmd column to set a hotkey (cmd-shift-p is what I use -- I had to restart for this to be picked up)
# Select "Entire Document" for Input
# Select "Home Directory" for Directory
# Select "Discard Output" for Output
# Select "Display in Alert" for Errors
# Clear out the existing script
# Paste the contents of PropertyFromInstanceVariable.pl into the script area

h1. Usage Instructions
# Go to an ivars block and type NSString *_name; (or whatever your declaration might be)
# Triple click the ivar line (to select the entire line)
# Run the "Generate Property" script (cmd-shift-p, or run it from the menu)
